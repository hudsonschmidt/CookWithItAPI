# CookWithItAPI

This API will be an API to query a database which stores recipes and their corresponding information. Each recipe would be stored as a row, likely containing an id, name, directions on how to make it, ingridients, how many people it serves, and nutrients such as calories and protein.  For example, an entry could be Fried Chicken, which serves 8 people and is 1000 calories with 100 grams of protein. Reciples could be queried by values to find something that fits people needs, such as protein >= 50 grams or calories < 800. 

Some cool things could be done from this database, such as filtering for meals fitting specific nutrient requirements. Users could also filter by how many people it feeds. There could also be an options to find meals the user could make based off of ingridients they have on hand.
